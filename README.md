# - This application is a CLI with several functions including 
#   an assembler for an SCI to simulate the behavior a computer
#   would have if once the assembled code was executed.
# - It is based of the two-pass assembler algorithm found in 
#   [*Name of Book*].
# - It is written to function in a Linux based environment.
# - All of its functions have been implemented with the
#   exception of the debug function, which is pending for an
#   updated version.
